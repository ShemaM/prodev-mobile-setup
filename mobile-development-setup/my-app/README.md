# 0. Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

## Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, this project utilizes the **Expo Framework** for React Native. This simplifies development and testing by allowing applications to run directly on a physical device, bypassing the need for heavy hardware-intensive emulators.

## Environment Requirements

To successfully complete this setup, the following tools were verified and installed:

* **Node.js LTS:** Installed for managing dependencies.

* **VS Code:** The primary IDE for development.
* **Operating System:** [Enter your OS, e.g., macOS / Windows / Linux]
* **Testing Device:** iPhone (with Expo Go installed)

## Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development typically relies on device emulators. However, maintaining emulators for various devices (e.g., iPhone 7 to iPhone 16 Pro Max) is costly in terms of hardware performance. **Expo Go** provides a cost-effective, high-performance solution by testing React Native applications directly on physical hardware.

## Installation & Setup Process

1. **Expo Go Installation:**
   -Navigated to [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go).
   -Selected the latest SDK version.
   -Installed the app on my iPhone via the **Apple App Store**.

2. **Account Configuration:**
   -Launched the Expo Go app.
   -Created a new account/Logged in to sync development projects.
3. **Local Setup:**
   -Initialized the GitHub repository: `prodev-mobile-setup`.
   -Created the directory: `mobile-development-setup`.
